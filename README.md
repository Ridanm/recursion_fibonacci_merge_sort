# Odin project(recursion) 
Enter a number to get the fibobacci sequence of that number.
These methods are one in its normal way of representing the 
fibonacci sequence and another does the same except that it 
is a recursive method.

### Merge Sort operation
###### 1- Split: 
        The original roster is split into two halves of similar size
     until there is only one element in each half (considered sorted itself).
###### 2- Recursive Sort: 
        The halves are sorted recursively by applying the Merge Sort to each half.
###### 3- Merge: 
        The ordered halves are combined into a new ordered list. In this step,
     compare the elements of the two halves and place them in order in the new list.
     The merge process continues until all halves are combined into a single ordered list.
